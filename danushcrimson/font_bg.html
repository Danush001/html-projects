 <h1>Nature Essay;</h1>
 <p>
Nature is the natural, physical, material world or universe. 
“Nature” can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. Our planet is rich in nature. 
Natural things look beautiful and attractive.
 Nature has flowing rivers, beautiful valleys, high mountains, singing birds, the oceans,
  the blue sky, different seasons, the rain, the beautiful moonlight etc.
   The beauty of nature is matchless.
    The blessings of nature on human beings are innumerable.

<h1>Importance and Role of Nature;</h1>
<p>
If there were no nature, we wouldn’t be alive.
 Humankind is dependent on nature. We get oxygen to breathe from plants and trees. 
 Thus, our respiratory system is regulated by nature.
  Not only this, nature has some magical healing powers which help patients suffering
   from various diseases to recover faster. 
   Every minute spent in the lap of nature gives a refreshing and rejuvenating feeling.
    It lowers the cortisol, commonly known as the stress hormone.
     Even placing some nice plants around the work window will lead to lower stress. 
     Nature enhances our brain’s activity and makes us concentrate better and be more focused. 
     This makes our brains more creative and imaginative. 
     Spending time in nature will provide a healthier and longer life.
</p>

<h1>Nature is very powerful and unique;</h1>
<p> 
Nature is also considered a source of education.
 We can learn humility from trees, the sturdiness from the mountains, 
 and to smile from flowers and buds to keep smiling in tough phases of life.

The natural cycle of our ecosystem is very necessary.
 Ecosystems contain biotic or living parts, as well as abiotic factors or nonliving parts. 
 Biotic factors include plants, animals, and other organisms. 
 Abiotic factors include rocks, temperature, and humidity. 
 Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor, either directly or indirectly.
  We must take care of all the components of the ecosystem as it fulfils all our needs.
</p>
<h1>Nature Conservation;</h1>
<p>
The resources provided on the earth are limited. 
If we continue to deplete the resources at this pace, then they will soon exhaust. 
Urbanisation and development have resulted in excessive use of resources. 
For example, we are cutting trees to make houses, roads, and railway tracks. 
We are mining minerals and fossil fuels for transportation activities. 
We are extensively using water for agriculture and other activities. 
Our comfort has led to the destruction of nature. 
Deforestation, global warming, wildlife destruction, environmental pollution, ecosystem imbalance etc.,
 are the consequences that threaten biodiversity and life on earth. 
 To overcome them, we need to conserve nature.
